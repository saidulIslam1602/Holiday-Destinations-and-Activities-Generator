## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/holiday-destinations-generator.git
cd holiday-destinations-generator
```

2. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Set up your OpenAI API key**:

   **Option A: Create API key file** (Recommended)
   ```bash
   echo "your-openai-api-key-here" > api_key.txt
   ```

   **Option B: Environment variable**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
   
   # Unix/Linux/macOS
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
   ```

4. **Start the application**:

   **🐍 Recommended: Python Startup Script** (Works on all platforms)
   ```bash
   python start_app.py
   ```

   **🪟 Windows: Batch Script**
   ```cmd
   run_app.bat
   ```

   **🐧 Unix/Linux/macOS: Shell Script**
   ```bash
   ./run_app.sh
   ```

   **⚙️ Manual Start** (if scripts don't work)
   ```bash
   # Set Python path and start
   set PYTHONPATH=%cd%  # Windows
   export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd):$PYTHONPATH  # Unix/Linux/macOS
   
   streamlit run src/ui/streamlit_app.py
   ```

5. **Open your browser** to `http://localhost:8501`

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'**
```bash
# Solution: Set Python path correctly
set PYTHONPATH=%cd%  # Windows
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd):$PYTHONPATH  # Unix/Linux/macOS

# Then run:
streamlit run src/ui/streamlit_app.py
```

**2. Missing Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**3. OpenAI API Key Issues**
- Ensure your API key is valid and has sufficient credits
- Check that the key is properly set in `api_key.txt` or environment variable
- Verify the key has fine-tuning permissions if using AI enhancement features

**4. Redis Connection Warning**
- This is normal if Redis is not installed
- The app will automatically fall back to disk caching
- To use Redis: Install and start Redis server

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Basic Usage

1. **Select Theme**: Choose from Sports, Historical Places, Natural Attractions, Scientific, or Entertainment
2. **Set Count**: Specify how many destinations you want (1-10)
3. **Include Activities**: Toggle whether to generate activities for each destination
4. **Generate**: Click the generate button and wait for AI-powered results

### Advanced Features

#### 🤖 AI Enhancement (Fine-Tuning)
1. Navigate to the "🤖 AI Models" tab
2. Click "🚀 Start Enhancement"
3. Wait 10-20 minutes for the process to complete
4. Enjoy more accurate and detailed destination recommendations

#### 📊 Analytics
- View your generation history and performance metrics
- Track response times and usage patterns
- Analyze your travel theme preferences

#### ⭐ Favorites
- Save destinations you're interested in
- Manage your saved destinations list
- Quick access to your preferred locations

### API Usage

The application also supports programmatic usage:

```python
from src.services import DestinationService
from src.models import GenerationRequest, ThemeType

# Initialize service
service = DestinationService()

# Create request
request = GenerationRequest(
    theme=ThemeType.NATURAL_ATTRACTION,
    count=3,
    include_activities=True
)

# Generate destinations
response = await service.generate_destinations(request)

# Access results
for destination in response.destinations:
    print(f"{destination.place}, {destination.country}")
    print(f"Rating: {destination.rating}/5")
    print(f"Best time: {destination.best_time_to_visit}")
```
